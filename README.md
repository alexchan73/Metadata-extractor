# Metadata-extractor

Thank you for coming across my program :)

What does it do? : You can enter in any files that end with (.pdf or .jpg)  to extract  metadata from. 

Why did I make this? : To demonstrate my knowledge on extracting EXIF data from photos and PDF files using python(Pike PDF, Pillow(PIL)). 

Important Note:
Do not use this tool for criminal purposes, i.e. stalking,  black hat hacking.
By doing so, you are subject to criminal penalties

To install the required packages(PikePDF and Pillow) follow the steps below:
sudo apt update

pip install PikePDF
pip install Pillow

When running the program, make sure you have the images in the same folder with the program. 

Not all images and PDFS will contain the data you are looking for, some companies(Google, META) will strip the data for security reasons.

Have fun :)
