# Metadata-extractor

Thank you for coming across my program :)

What does it do? : You can enter in any files that have EXIF type data to extract metadata from. 

Why did I make this? : To demonstrate my knowledge on extracting EXIF data from files that could be crucial in investigations. 

Disclaimer:
* Do not use this tool for criminal purposes, i.e. stalking,  black hat hacking.
* By doing so, you are subject to criminal penalties

TO INSTALL REQUIRED PACKAGES:
* You must have exiftool downloaded onto your system, here is the link: https://exiftool.org/
* To use exiftool in python, you must have pyexiftool installed, here is the link: https://sylikc.github.io/pyexiftool/examples.html

HOW TO USE:
* In the beginning it will display the current directory you are in such as (Users/alex/Documents), it will then ask you to type in the full directory 
of where you think the file is, in this case it will be in the Documents folder. 

* It will list out all of the files and other directories and will prompt if you want to go further into a another directory. If you see your file in the directory you are viewing, you can press "n". 

* The program will then prompt you to enter the full directory of where the file is. 
For example: "/Users/alex/Documents/img.txt"

* Then the data should be outputted :)

Not all images and PDFS will contain the data you are looking for, some companies(Google, META) will strip the data for security reasons.

Have fun :)
